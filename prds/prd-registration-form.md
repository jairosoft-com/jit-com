# PRD: Registration Form Implementation

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a user registration form on the main page. The form will collect user information and submit it to a specified endpoint. The primary goal is to gather user details in a simple, user-friendly manner while ensuring all required fields are completed before submission.

## 2. Goals
- Provide a seamless registration experience for general public users
- Collect essential user information including name, email, phone number, and optional training interest
- Ensure data is properly validated before submission
- Provide clear feedback upon successful form submission
- Maintain consistency with the existing design system

## 3. User Stories
- As a website visitor, I want to register my details so that I can express interest in the services
- As a user, I want to see clear validation messages so that I can correct any mistakes in my submission
- As a user, I want to receive confirmation when my registration is successful

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The form must include the following fields:
   - Full Name (required, text input)
   - Email Address (required, email validation)
   - Phone Number (required, phone number validation)
   - Training Interested In (required, text input)

2. Form Validation:
   - All fields must be completed before submission
   - Email must be in a valid format
   - Phone number must be in a valid format
   - Validation messages should appear for any invalid or missing required fields

3. Form Submission:
   - On submission, data should be sent via POST to: https://5446fa86-16bf-48b6-a8c3-0f2dbafe5cb3.mock.pstmn.io/register
   - Show loading state during submission
   - On success, display a success message to the user
   - On error, display an appropriate error message
   - Form should be reset after successful submission

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- User authentication or account creation
- Email verification
- Password management
- User profile management
- Social media login integration

## 6. Design Considerations
- Follow the existing design system for form elements
- Use consistent spacing and typography as per current UI guidelines
- Form should be responsive and work on all device sizes
- Error states should be clearly visible and accessible
- Success message should be prominent and clear

## 7. Technical Considerations
- Use existing form components from the design system
- Implement client-side validation before submission
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Ensure form is accessible (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Implement proper loading states during form submission

## 8. Success Metrics
- Form submission success rate
- Form completion rate
- Error rate on form submission
- Average time to complete the form

## 9. Open Questions
- Are there any specific error messages or validation rules for the phone number field?
- Should there be any character limits on the text inputs?
- Is there a specific success message that should be displayed?
- Are there any analytics events that need to be tracked on form interaction?

## 10. Implementation Notes
- The form should be implemented as a reusable component
- Form state should be managed efficiently to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Consider implementing debouncing for input validation
- Ensure proper error handling for network issues
