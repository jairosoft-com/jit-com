# PRD: User Sign-Up Page and Functionality

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a user sign-up page that allows new users to create an account. The sign-up process will collect essential user information and provide immediate access to the platform upon successful registration.

## 2. Goals
1. Enable new users to create accounts quickly and easily
2. Collect necessary user information (First Name, Last Name, Email, Password)
3. Ensure data security and validation
4. Provide immediate access to the platform after sign-up
5. Maintain consistency with the existing design system

## 3. User Stories
1. As a new user, I want to create an account using my email and password so that I can access the platform.
2. As a new user, I want to see clear error messages if I enter invalid information.
3. As a new user, I want to be logged in immediately after successful registration.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Form Fields
1. The sign-up form must include the following required fields:
   - First Name (text input)
   - Last Name (text input)
   - Email (email input)
   - Password (password input, minimum 8 characters)
   - Confirm Password (password input)

### 4.2 Validation
1. Client-side validation must be implemented for all fields:
   - First Name: Required, max 50 characters
   - Last Name: Required, max 50 characters
   - Email: Required, valid email format
   - Password: Required, minimum 8 characters
   - Confirm Password: Must match Password field

### 4.3 Error Handling
1. Display clear error messages for:
   - Required fields that are left empty
   - Invalid email format
   - Password length requirement not met
   - Password and Confirm Password mismatch
   - Existing email address
   - Server-side validation errors

### 4.4 Authentication
1. Implement email and password authentication
2. Upon successful sign-up:
   - Create user account in the database
   - Log the user in automatically
   - Redirect to the dashboard or home page

### 4.5 Security
1. Passwords must be hashed before storage
2. Implement CSRF protection
3. Rate limiting for sign-up attempts

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Social media authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.)
2. Email verification
3. Password reset functionality
4. Profile picture upload
5. Multi-factor authentication

## 6. Design Considerations
1. Follow the existing design system
2. Mobile-responsive layout
3. Clear call-to-action button
4. Link to login page for existing users
5. Loading state during form submission

## 7. Technical Considerations
1. Backend:
   - API endpoint for user registration
   - Input validation
   - User authentication
   - Session management

2. Frontend:
   - Form validation
   - Error message display
   - Loading states
   - Success redirect

## 8. Success Metrics
1. Number of successful sign-ups per day/week
2. Sign-up form completion rate
3. Time to complete sign-up
4. Error rate during sign-up

## 9. Open Questions
1. Should we implement a "Remember Me" checkbox?
2. Do we need to add a CAPTCHA or similar bot prevention?
3. Should we add a password strength indicator?
4. What should be the maximum length for the password field?
5. Should we implement any analytics tracking for the sign-up flow?
