# Sign-In Feature PRD

## Introduction/Overview
The Sign-In feature enables users to securely authenticate and access their dashboard. This functionality is essential for maintaining user data privacy and providing personalized access to the application's features.

## Goals
1. Provide a secure and user-friendly authentication mechanism for all users
2. Ensure consistent design with the existing application
3. Implement robust error handling for user input validation
4. Enable seamless access to the dashboard post-authentication

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to securely sign in using my email and password so that I can access my dashboard
2. As a user, I want to receive clear error messages if my sign-in credentials are invalid
3. As a user, I want the sign-in form to maintain consistent design with the rest of the application

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must:
   1.1 Accept user email and password inputs
   1.2 Validate email format (must be valid email address)
   1.3 Require both email and password fields to be filled
   1.4 Make API call to https://5446fa86-16bf-48b6-a8c3-0f2dbafe5cb3.mock.pstmn.io/sign-in
   1.5 Handle API response and errors appropriately
   1.6 Redirect to dashboard upon successful sign-in
   1.7 Display appropriate error messages for invalid credentials
   1.8 Maintain consistent UI/UX with the signup page

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Implementing alternative authentication methods (e.g., social login)
2. Implementing multi-factor authentication
3. Implementing password reset functionality
4. Implementing session management

## Design Considerations
1. The sign-in form must:
   1.1 Use the existing design system and components from the signup page
   1.2 Maintain consistent color scheme and typography
   1.3 Follow the same form layout and validation patterns
   1.4 Use the same error message styling
   1.5 Maintain responsive design across all screen sizes

## Technical Considerations
1. Frontend:
   1.1 Use React/TypeScript for implementation
   1.2 Implement form state management
   1.3 Use axios or fetch for API calls
   1.4 Implement proper error handling and user feedback

2. API Integration:
   2.1 Use the provided mock endpoint: https://5446fa86-16bf-48b6-a8c3-0f2dbafe5cb3.mock.pstmn.io/sign-in
   2.2 Handle HTTP status codes appropriately
   2.3 Implement loading states during API calls

## Success Metrics
1. 100% of sign-in attempts receive appropriate feedback (success/error)
2. No UI inconsistencies with the signup page
3. All form validation works as expected
4. Users can successfully access the dashboard after signing in

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement any form of password strength requirements?
2. Should there be a maximum number of failed attempts before temporary lockout?
3. Should we implement any session timeout mechanism?
4. Should there be a "Remember me" option for persistent login?
5. Should we implement any additional security measures (e.g., rate limiting)?
